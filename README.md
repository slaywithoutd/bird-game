Bird Game 🐦✨

This is a simple game built as part of a university exercise to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Phaser. In the game, a bird follows a diagonal flight pattern, moving up and to the right before gliding down and to the left in a continuous loop.

Feel free to check out the code and suggest improvements! 🚀
